<h2>MATLAB Scripts for Dr. Sharma's Numerical Analysis Course</h2>

<p>
Our text book provides a set of <a
  href="http://math.fullerton.edu/mathews/software/software.html">functions and
  scripts</a> for various numerical
methods.  However, since the book is primarily a mathematical text it does not
go into much detail as to how to use these functions.  Additionally, this book
was written in 2004, so there are occasional issues with the scripts when
running on newer versions of MATLAB.  I am providing some modified files to help
with both of these issues.
</p>

<p>
The functions I am providing have been tested on Matlab 2006a, as well as the
free alternative GNU Octave.  I do not have a copy of later versions of MATLAB,
but will try to fix issues on those systems if they arise.</p>

<p>If you would like to use my scripts, for some improved documentation and
updated code, you can download them as a  <a
  href="http://github.com/sandal/sharma-numerical/zipball/master">zip
  file</a></p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
Unzip the file using whatever works for you on your system.  It will have a
hideous foldder name because it is auto-generated from an exact version of the code I'm
running on my machine.  You might want to rename this folder 'sharma-numerical'
or something similar.</p>

<p>
Inside, you will find a README.txt, read that before you go on.   Then, what you
will want to do is add the sharma-numerical/book folder to your MATLAB path.  If
you have downloaded the scripts from the book's website or have an earlier copy
of my code, be sure to either remove the path for those, or remove the
individual scripts so that you don't have two functions with the same name
loaded.  If this all sounds greek to you, take a look at the <a
  href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_env/f10-26235.html#f10-40176">Set
  Path</a> documentation.  what you just did is tell MATLAB where to find the
M-files you'll be using.  Now test to make sure that everything is set up
right.</p>

<h3>Using the functions</h3>

<p>I take advantage of MATLAB's help function to provide good documentation.  If
all goes well, you should be able to do something like this on your console:</p>

<pre>
>> help bisect
Bisection Method (p.59)
  To approximate the root of the equation f(x) = 0 in the interval [a,b].
  Use this method only if f(x) is continuous and f(a) and f(b) have
  opposite signs.

FUNCTION SIGNATURE: [c,yc,err] = bisect(f,a,b,delta)
 
  input  - f is an inline function or reference to an mfile
         - a and b are the left and right endpoints
         - delta is the tolerance

  output - c is the zero
         - yc = f(c)
         - err is error est. for c

USAGE:
 Via an inline function:
  f = @(x) x * sin(x) - 1
  [c,yc,err] = bisect(f, 0, 2, 0.001)

 Via an mfile (example.m):
   [c,yc,err = bisect(@example, 0, 2, 0.0001)

 NOTE:
 If f(a)*f(b) is positive, function will raise an error and exit.
</pre>

<p>Doesn't that look nicer than what the book has to offer?</p>

<p>Every program we're assigned to work with in class will be added to this
package at least a few days before we need to use it.   That means that you will
need to re-download it to get the latest versions, but that you can be sure that
they'll be available by the time you need them. If you want to keep track of the
latest changes, have a look at the <a
  href="http://github.com/sandal/sharma-numerical/commits/master">project
  timeline</a>.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer / Contact</h3>

<p>I don't make any guarentees that this stuff is without bugs or mistakes.  I'll
be using it for my course work, and thought it might be of value to others to
provide some updated scripts with better docs than what is found in the book.
But if these things go terribly wrong and eat your computer or make you fail an
exam, don't come hunting me down.</p>

<p>That having been said, if you think you've run into problems, email me.  While I
don't have the time or expertise to troubleshoot general MATLAB problems, I'll
happily fix any issues that come up with these scripts.</p>

Enjoy!  (gregory.t.brown at gmail.com)
